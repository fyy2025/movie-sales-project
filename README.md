Beginning in 1914, filmmaking exploded with the rise of independant film distributors â€“ more than 4,200 new films were created that year. American filmmaking grew rapidly over the next century, catering to a diverse market that crosses racial, ethnic and political lines. In 1930, more than 65% of Americans saw a movie at least once a week. Movies have become a dominant part of American and international leisure time (Croteau et al. 2021).

In this project, we focused on the top 1000 highest grossing hollywood films. As a technology of entertainment, movies are not just attractive images; they are a result of an industry driven by market forces (Croteau et al. 2021). All of the pieces of a movie are carefully and purposefully designed, including the title, runtime, and genre. Movies and movie genres perform differently in different regions, and these elements are closely related to the ultimate profits of the film.

The two research questions discussed in this project are:

1. How do different genres and combinations of genres influence the preference ratio of domestic sales over total sales of movies?
2. Is there a difference in the international and domestic preference of movie attributes?

Movies have various genres, including: action, comedy, family, science fiction, and romance. Different countries have their own styles and areas of expertise in the film industry; Japan and Thailand are famous for their thriller movies, while the United States is definitely leading the world in science fiction films. Furthermore, some other variables such as the budget, minutes, month, and imdb_score also have a great influence on how well a movie performs. These factors piqued our curiosity about the consistency of international and domestic sales. These questions can help us understand the disparity between domestic and international preference.

Advertising and exporting films globally requires a large investment, and sometimes the return on those investments are low. This research can help filmmakers and decide where and how to advertise their films based on the attributes of the film. A better understanding of the preferences of certain populations can help people in the film industry make wise investment decisions. With the results of this research, we can help the movie industry maximize profits and allow consumers better access to movies that interest them the most.
